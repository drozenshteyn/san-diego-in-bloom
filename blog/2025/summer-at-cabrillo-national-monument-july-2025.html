    <h2>Summer at Cabrillo National Monument – A Seasonal Series</h2>
<p class="post-date">Posted on <time datetime="2025-07-11">July 11, 2025</time></p>

<p>For over 30 years, Cabrillo National Monument has been one of my favorite places to visit. Whether I come for the sweeping views, the peaceful trails, or simply the ocean breeze, each visit feels both familiar and full of possibility.</p>

<p>As a photographer, this place never stops inspiring me. The light, the clouds, the marine layer, the colors of the sea, the plants blooming in different seasons—it all changes constantly.<br>
Every time I bring my camera here, there's always a story waiting to be captured.</p>

<p>This post marks the first in a blog series, where I’ll explore the changing moods and textures of Cabrillo through the seasons. We begin with summer—a time of bright skies, blooming buckwheat, crashing waves, and subtle wildflower surprises.</p>

<h3>The Lighthouse</h3>

<p>Let’s begin where nearly all my visits to Cabrillo begin—the Old Point Loma Lighthouse. Built in 1855, it served as a beacon until 1891 and still stands as one of the park’s most beloved icons.

On this summer visit, buckwheat blooms framed its silhouette beneath a sky full of soft, cottony clouds—a peaceful, timeless Cabrillo moment.</p>

<h3>Hiking at Cabrillo</h3>

<p>Cabrillo offers breathtaking views from several scenic trails, each one adding a unique perspective on the coastal beauty of the park.</p>
More info: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cabr/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cabrillo National Monument Official Site</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bayside Trail (2.5 miles round-trip):</strong> This paved-and-gravel trail gently descends the eastern side of the park, offering breathtaking views of San Diego Bay, downtown, Coronado Island, and the layered cliffs below. In summer, California buckwheat thrives along this trail, softening the rugged terrain with a wash of pale blooms.</li>

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqhrahy8h/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1752188099/Cabrillo_Monument_summer_collage_ocean_views_c7byen.jpg" alt="Summer collage showing California buckwheat blooming along cliffs, turquoise ocean views, heart-shaped rock formation on Bayside Trail, and historic military building at Cabrillo National Monument">

<p>This set of images captures Cabrillo’s coastal energy in midsummer. During one of my hikes along the Bayside Trail, I spotted a heart-shaped rock tucked into an overlook—clearly left by someone feeling the beauty of the place. There’s also a glimpse of a preserved military structure from the Fort Rosecrans coastal defense system, built during World War II. These old buildings still stand throughout the park, quietly reminding us of its layered history.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oceanside Trail (approx. 2.5 miles round-trip):</strong> Opened in 2024, this more strenuous route begins just south of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse and descends to the ocean’s edge. It’s a wonderful sunset spot and avoids road walking, making it my new favorite way to reach the tide pools.</li>

Waves crash and spray, carving out natural sculptures—including a charming heart-shaped pool nestled in the stone—a perfect blend of calm and energy along the shore.">
  
  <li><strong>Tidepool Area:</strong> Accessible by car or trail, this zone is a study in contrasts—calm and chaos, solid rock and surging sea.</li>

<p>Near the tidepool cliffs, you can find this heart-shaped pool nestled in the rocks—serene and still one moment, and just moments later, a crashing wave shatters the quiet. Water droplets dance through the air, suspended for a split second. The sea is never still here.</p>

<h3>Textures of Late June</h3>

<p>This year’s June visit brought vibrant contrasts: a close-up of the American flag at the lighthouse catching the wind, blooming Chaparral Mallow and Mariposa Lily, and cacti soaking in the sunlight. These dry-season blooms are fleeting but offer a colorful counterpoint to the dusty trails.</p>

<h3>Summer Memories in Bloom</h3>

<p>Here’s a little visual journal of summer moments from past visits—views of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, blooming succulents basking in the sun, and resilient wildflowers making their quiet appearances in the dry heat. Even in a season not known for peak color, nature finds a way to show off.</p>

<h3> Until Next Bloom...</h3>

<p>Summer at Cabrillo is sun-soaked and filled with quiet drama—from the cliffs and tidepools to the textures of wild blooms and stone. I hope this post gave you a glimpse of the season’s character.</p>

<p><strong> <em>Next up in this series:</em></strong> exploring the dramatic light and shadows of Cabrillo through black-and-white photography — a different way to see summer’s harsh sun and textured landscapes.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading—until next bloom! 🌼 Diana</em></p>
